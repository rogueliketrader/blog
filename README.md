### Trade 1 - To YPOC
In the overnight, I took 1 trade on both my ETF and BlueSky accounts.
- 1 NQ long to yesterday POC
- Setup: classic setup where overnight price moves towards yesterday's POC
- Reason: Opening had downward movement but then started to make higher lows
- TP: exited 2 points early as POC is an area and it looked like price would reject
- Improvements: Should have held.  Would have been +10 points
- Emotions:
Taking an overnight trade is always scary because the result is not known for a longer period of time compared to RTH.
ES had a very clear higher low setup whereas NQ has more choppy price action.  I wait for more confirmation on NQ before taking the NQ trade.
Today is also a holiday, so was not expecting lots of price movement.

## Missed Trade 2 - ES OVN Low Mean Reversion
At 5:30AM (EU session) ES swept overnight lows.  Very classic setup.  
It hit the daily trendline making a higher low and rejected.
This could have been a 120+ point trade.
- Thoughts: There was nothing I could have done to be in on this trade because I was asleep
- Emotions:
I spent last night backtesting ORB, which I found was not a trade setup for me due to its large losses or perhaps I'm not trading it correctly.
I'm still feeling emotions from missing out on this awesome trade.  This was an A setup and would have been able to pass the evals.
Though I'm reminding myself trades will always come, having A setups that come isn't that frequent with this price action lately.
Perhaps I could have set an alert, but as a heavy sleeping I probably would have missed it anyways.
I need to give myself some grace: working FT, new baby, all the 5 kids home, cooking and cleaning.  There is no comparison to these online gurus.
The market will always be there and there will be another trade - patience pays.

## Missed Trade 3 - Signal Candle Mean Reversion
In last hour had 15m signal candle with very high volume.
- Could have traded to POC ~30 points
- B setup b/c to clear sweep
- Emotions:
Less attachment to this trade because its not top tier.

### Missed Trade 1 - Discord Callout
In overnight, a signal candle formed and admin called out they were long and holding until overnight highs.
- This was not in my playbook
- Emotions:
I actually logged into my broker and almost placed a long trade.  Very glad I did not even thought the trade worked out for 100+ points.
I have problems with chasing and feeling FOMO due to server callouts.  One thing about the server callouts is they call out the trade only after their entry is long past.
So this would have been a late entry meaning I missed the trade.  Happy I stuck to my rules.  If I'm late, then I missed the trade.  Wait for the next one.

### Trade 1 - LOSS - NQ Mean Reversion POC
Placed after NQ swept OVN high.  Expecting POC
- Slightly late entry, would have been 1:1
- Stopped out on pullback, then next 2 minutes immediately dumped to target

### Trade 2 - LOSS - Chasing Candle
This is part of the loss above.  There was 1 engulfing green candle.  I assumed this signaled upside but price stalled, then dumped to original TP.
- Emotions:
I was chasing the green candle and should kept to my original plan above due to the sweep

### Trade 3 - ES Sweep Mean Reversion
As a result of the 2 losses above, I patiently waited for the usual setup.  Since price looked bullish and looked very rangely, expecting a sweep and mean reversion play.
Waited for ES to sweep, then took a short on both accounts.  Was able to make back the losses and then some.  Trailed pretty tightly and got stopped out.

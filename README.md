# Welcome to my trading journey

This site is meant to track my thoughts, feelings, emotions, and trades.

## 01/20/2025 - MLK

### Trade 1 - To YPOC
In the overnight, I took 1 trade on both my ETF and BlueSky accounts.
- 1 NQ long to yesterday POC
- Setup: classic setup where overnight price moves towards yesterday's POC
- Reason: Opening had downward movement but then started to make higher lows
- TP: exited 2 points early as POC is an area and it looked like price would reject
- Improvements: Should have held.  Would have been +10 points
- Emotions:
Taking an overnight trade is always scary because the result is not known for a longer period of time compared to RTH.
ES had a very clear higher low setup whereas NQ has more choppy price action.  I wait for more confirmation on NQ before taking the NQ trade.
Today is also a holiday, so was not expecting lots of price movement.

## Missed Trade 2 - ES OVN Low Mean Reversion
At 5:30AM (EU session) ES swept overnight lows.  Very classic setup.  
It hit the daily trendline making a higher low and rejected.
This could have been a 120+ point trade.
- Thoughts: There was nothing I could have done to be in on this trade because I was asleep
- Emotions:
I spent last night backtesting ORB, which I found was not a trade setup for me due to its large losses or perhaps I'm not trading it correctly.
I'm still feeling emotions from missing out on this awesome trade.  This was an A setup and would have been able to pass the evals.
Though I'm reminding myself trades will always come, having A setups that come isn't that frequent with this price action lately.
Perhaps I could have set an alert, but as a heavy sleeping I probably would have missed it anyways.
I need to give myself some grace: working FT, new baby, all the 5 kids home, cooking and cleaning.  There is no comparison to these online gurus.
The market will always be there and there will be another trade - patience pays.

## Missed Trade 3 - Signal Candle Mean Reversion
In last hour had 15m signal candle with very high volume.
- Could have traded to POC ~30 points
- B setup b/c to clear sweep
- Emotions:
Less attachment to this trade because its not top tier.
